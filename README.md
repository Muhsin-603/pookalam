# Digital Pookkalam

A digital representation of the traditional Onam Pookkalam created using HTML and CSS. This project creates an intricate and visually stunning flower carpet design that's traditionally made during the Onam festival in Kerala, India.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to screen sizes using min() function
- Complex layered design structure with multiple elements:
  - Border pattern with repetitive units
  - Outermost circle with gradient effects
  - Inner flower container with organized patterns
  - Multiple petal layers with different color schemes
- Rich gradient color patterns including:
  - Radial gradients for circular elements
  - Linear gradients for petal designs
  - Multiple color stops for depth and dimension
- Sophisticated positioning system using:
  - Absolute positioning for precise control
  - Transform translations for element placement
  - Relative positioning for pattern groups

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - Advanced Positioning (Absolute, Relative)
  - CSS Transform properties
  - Complex Gradient Systems
  - Box-shadow for depth
  - Border-radius for curved shapes
  - Custom Properties for maintainability
  - Flexbox for container centering

## Structure

The Pookkalam is structured in hierarchical layers:

1. Pookkalam Container (Main wrapper)
2. Pookkalam Group (Transformation container)
   - Border Pattern Layer
   - Outermost Circle
   - Inner Flower Container
     - Triangle Pattern
     - Outer Circle
     - Main Pattern (Petal Set)
     - Overlay Patterns
       - Orange Pattern Group
       - Red Pattern Group
   - Center Circles (Large and Small)

## Implementation Details

### Color Scheme
- Dark greens and blacks for base patterns
- Orange and red gradients for overlay patterns
- Gold and crimson for accent elements
- Strategic use of transparency for layering effects

### Special Effects
- Box shadows for depth perception
- Border outlines for pattern definition
- Multiple gradient layers for rich coloring
- Transform-origin manipulation for precise rotations
